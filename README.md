StereoX One is designed to widen the surround sound of your speakers. This is done by increasing the stereo width and adding a slight reverb to the sound to make post processors like Dolby Atmos and Dolby PLIIx sound better.

Is has been tested on a 5 point surround sound system with a ONKYO amplifier (TX-SR508) running on Dolby Pro Logic IIx (Studio-Mix) and it was found that StereoX One made the surround sound way more immersive.

This profile is perfect for:
- Music
    - Ambient and Chillout
    - Drum and Bass/Breakcore (Tested with)
    - Jazz
    - Classical
- Movies
    - Action
    - Drama
    - Sci-Fi
    - Horror
- Games
    - Action

This profile is not recommended for any audio that is speech related since the reverb can make the speech harder to understand.

### ClearVoice

ClearVoice 1.0 is designed to make the voice of the person you are listening to more clear. This is done by increasing the mid and high range of the sound and but keeping the warm low tones. It has post processing to remove some background noise to better isolate the voice from the background.

This profile is perfect for:
- Audio books
- Meetings
- Podcasts


Not recommended for:
- Any music
- Movies
- Games

This is because the profile mutes out allot of the music and sound effects to make the voice more clear.

This profile is done using the **Linux Studio Plugins** and **DeepFilterNet** plugins.
